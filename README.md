# SeminarClimateNetworks

## Environmental Policy 1 - Climate Policy Networks 

Mitigating climate change (CC) is a complex policy problem. Sources of harmful greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be found in almost all societal and economic sectors. Likewise, the group of polluters is diverse, ranging from the industrial enterprise to the individual. Effective climate policies must be designed to cope with this diversity in target groups. Hence, when formulating and implementing climate policy, the responsible decision-makers necessarily coordinate with a wide range of stakeholders like administrative entities from different sectors, political parties, interest groups, civil society organizations, or scientific institutions. In addition, tackling CC is a multi-level game since representatives of national governments negotiate at international conferences to coordinate international climate protection action. Decisions made at the international level must then be translated into national and subnational policies.

In this class, we aim to disentangle this complexity, by identifying the stakeholders, analyzing their beliefs and interests, and studying factors that influence their coordination behavior in the different arenas of policymaking. Studying these factors across a range of selected case studies, we also try to shed light on the question of why some countries enact more ambitious climate change policies than others.

The objective of this course is therefore twofold: Firstly, we attempt to comprehend the socio-economic and political determinants of mitigating CC in different countries. Secondly, we use policy networks as an analytical tool to operationalize key concepts of relevant public policy theories. Second, we use network analysis as a method to analyze various types of relational data (e.g., coordination, collaboration, shared opinions, etc.). For this purpose, students will be able to analyze real, scientific data.

The course is organized in a flipped classroom format, i.e. class time is devoted to the discussion of readings and screencasts, concepts, student presentations, and exercises.

Requirements: Some prior knowledge of R.
